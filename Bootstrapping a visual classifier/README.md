This contains the code for clustering gait into different movement clusters, and then using those clusters as pseudolabels to train a terrain classification vision system.

(left) Clustered gait types identified in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9555789. Depending on how low in the hierarchy, the data could be
divided into flat ground vs. stair walking, or further subdivided into turning gait, straight walking, and stair ascent and
descent. (right) Mean knee angles for each of the clusters. The kinematic trajectories are distinct for different kinds of
ambulation, leading to clusters that differentiate ambulation modes.
