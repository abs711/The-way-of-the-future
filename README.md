# The-way-of-the-future
A dataset of egocentric vision, eye-tracking and full body kinematics from human locomotion in out-of-the-lab environments. The data can be accessed on figshare- https://figshare.com/s/06ef299a0cd56a5a998c

'csvSave_v5_kine_only.m' generates the processed .csv files with Kinematics data from the raw mvnx files.
'cvSave_v5_kinematics_and_vision.m' generates the same and also saves the id of synchronized vision frames.


Please refer to the visualizations below to verify the synchronization of Vision and Kinematics streams. These can be generated using the script 'custom_humanoid.m' in ./Visualizations/
